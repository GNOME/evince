REPLACE-ME: Explain in short what is the problem, e.g: crashed while opening PDF document

### Description

REPLACE-ME: more detailed description of the problem. If the problem happens on a specific document, please add a link or attach the document. If evince is crashing, a backtrace is always useful.

Attached you can find the document and the backtrace after the crash"
